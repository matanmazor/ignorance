Matan, 03/07/2022:
In the first batch of 220 subjects, the time-locking line in the 
code was commented out. This was fixed in the second batch. I updated the
protocol folder with this change to the code.
This means that the seed for the first 220 subjects was chosen randomly
(from the date), but for the others it was a function of their participant
number and protocol sum.
