the two patrol boats there will be a 3-square submarine in the water too. \n
More imporantly, this time your task is not to play the game, but to watch the games
of two other participants. One of them played normally, trying to sink all ships
with as few clicks as possible. But the other participant knew where the ships were,
and his or her task was to trick you into thinking they played fairly. This player
will be given a bonus if they manage to trick you. If they fail, you get the bonus instead.
So concentrate, because after watching the two games you will decide who pretended
and who played fair.</p>`,
