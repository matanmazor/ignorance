<img src="docs/figures/methods2.png" alt="Experimental Design in Exp. 1 (upper panel) and 2 (lower panel). In non-pretend games, players revealed ships by guessing cells in a grid (A) or revealed a word by guessing letters (D). In pretend games, we marked ship locations with a cross (B) and revealed the target word from the start (E), but asked players to play as if they didnâ€™t have this information. Lastly, players watched replays of the games of previous players and guessed which were pretend games (C and F)." width="500"/>

A series of experiments looking at people's ability to pretend they don't know something.

## Data
Raw data from all four experiments is available on the project's OSF repository: [osf.io/zma9b/](https://osf.io/zma9b/files/osfstorage/)

## Analysis Scripts
[All pre-registered analyses](https://github.com/matanmazor/ignorance/blob/main/docs/preregisteredMethodsAndResults.Rmd), [exploratory analyses](https://github.com/matanmazor/ignorance/blob/main/docs/ExploratoryResults.Rmd), and [the paper itself in a data-to-paper Rmarkdown format](https://github.com/matanmazor/ignorance/blob/main/docs/paper.Rmd) are available in the 'docs' subdirectory.

The outputs of the scripts are available in gitbook format (both [preregistered](https://matanmazor.github.io/ignorance/docs/exp.-1-battleship.html) and [exploratory](https://matanmazor.github.io/ignorance/docs/exp.-1-battleship-exploratory-results.html) analyses)
